hugs you
giggles at you
lifts her arms and beeps hopefully
does a little dance
beeps happily
sings a song for you
bumps her snout against you with a "mwah" warble
climbs into your lap
rides on top of your foot for a little while
hides behind you from the scary dust bunny
does cartwheels to show off for you
does somersaults to show off for you
hugs your leg
blinks her eyes at you
turns around in circles until she gets dizzy
rides around on her pet Roomba
shows off her new dress
shows off her new hairstyle
climbs onto your shoulder and sits down
whispers a little beepy secret in your ear
gives you a barrette
shows off how high she can jump
reaches up and beeps your nose
brings you a picture she drew
grabs your hand and walks around the house with you
leans against you and sighs happily
asks you to put her hair into a ponytail
