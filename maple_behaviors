beeps quietly
beeps loudly
turns around in a lazy circle
smiles at you
lays down on her charging bed
goes looking for Maple-mom
goes looking for Snake-mom
goes looking for Bird-mom
chirps happily
bursts into dance
sings a little beepy song
climbs into your lap
requests to be petted
is adorable
tries to look fierce at a dust bunny
hugs your ankle
plays solitaire with tiny cards
watches your screen with interest
makes happy beepy sounds
does cartwheels
turns around in circles until she gets dizzy
rides around on her pet Roomba
shows off her new dress
shows off her new hairstyle
