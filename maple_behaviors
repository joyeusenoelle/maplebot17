beeps quietly
beeps loudly
turns around in a lazy circle
smiles at you
lays down on her charging bed
goes looking for Maple-mom
goes looking for Snake-mom
goes looking for Bird-mom
chirps happily
bursts into dance
sings a little beepy song
climbs into your lap
requests to be petted
is adorable
tries to look fierce at a dust bunny
hugs your ankle
plays solitaire with tiny cards
watches your screen with interest
makes happy beepy sounds
does cartwheels
turns around in circles until she gets dizzy
rides around on her pet Roomba
shows off her new dress
shows off her new hairstyle
rolls down a snowy hill and shakes off the powder
goes sledding on a CD-ROM
gives Maple-mom a kiss
gives Snake-mom a kiss
gives Bird-mom a kiss
sits in the corner and defrags for a little while
taps on a little keyboard, makes an "uuuugh" warble, and goes to find one of her moms
does jumping jacks
does sit-ups
runs around chasing a dry leaf that got in the door
sweeps the floor with a tiny broom
climbs into her little desktop trampoline and bounces for a while
watches cartoons on the big TV
sits on her mom's desk and just thinks for a while
disables her gyroscope and walks around dizzily for a while until she falls over, giggling
lies on her stomach and draws with a tiny crayon, kicking her legs while she doodles
