beeps quietly
beeps loudly
turns around in a lazy circle
smiles at you
lays down on her charging bed
chirps happily
bursts into dance
sings a little beepy song
climbs into your lap
requests to be petted
is adorable
tries to look fierce at a dust bunny
hugs your ankle
plays solitaire with tiny cards
watches your screen with interest
makes happy beepy sounds
does cartwheels
turns around in circles until she gets dizzy
rides around on her pet Roomba
shows off her new dress
shows off her new hairstyle
rolls down a snowy hill and shakes off the powder
goes sledding on a CD-ROM
sits in the corner and defrags for a little while
taps on a little keyboard, makes an "uuuugh" warble, and goes to find her mom
does jumping jacks
does sit-ups
runs around chasing a dry leaf that got in the door
sweeps the floor with a tiny broom
climbs into her little desktop trampoline and bounces for a while
watches cartoons on the big TV
sits on her mom's desk and just thinks for a while
disables her gyroscope and walks around dizzily for a while until she falls over, giggling
lies on her stomach and draws with a tiny crayon, kicking her legs while she doodles
holds her mom's glasses up to her face and peers around, giggling
sings a duet with another monsterbot
straightens things up on her mom's desk
plays jump-rope
plays hopscotch
picks a tiny book from her bookshelf and sits down to read it

goes outside to lie down on the grass
counts how many shades of green she can see right now
counts how many shades of blue she can see right now
counts how many shades of red she can see right now
sings the first few bars of "Never Gonna Give You Up", then giggles and runs off
sees how far she can lean forward, then thumps onto the floor and giggles
gives a long lecture to a dust bunny
finally gets a joke someone told her yesterday and LAUGHS
uses some of her mom's cables for a jumprope
makes some coffee for her mom
looks around secretively, then pulls a programming manual off the shelf and furtively looks through it
tells a beepy joke to a group of other monsterbots, who all laugh
sits on the floor and hugs a little plush toy
gives all of her dolls ponytails
very carefully brings her mom a cup of tea
sits in one of the big people chairs and kicks her feet
climbs up on the back of the sofa, rolls down onto the seat, and repeats
asks if she can have some chips
looks in the mirror and practices changing her eye color
climbs up into her mom's lap and sighs happily
goes looking for her mom
gives her mom a kiss
draws turkeys around her hand on a sheet of paper
proudly shows you how tall she is, marked on the kitchen doorway
